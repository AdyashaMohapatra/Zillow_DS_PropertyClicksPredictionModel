🏡 Zillow Property Interaction Prediction
---
“This project is independently created using publicly available data. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Zillow.”

The goal is to build a predictive model that would say the number of interactions that a property would receive in a period of time. In this analysis, I dive deep into property listings and user interaction data to uncover patterns and build predictive models to determine how likely a property is to get requests within the first 3 or 7 days.

📌 Objective

Management wants to optimize visibility of properties that are likely to receive immediate user interest.
The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze multiple Zillow datasets 📊
- Engineer features and transform raw data 🔧
- Predict number of user interactions within 3 and 7 days using classical and deep learning methods 🤖
- Provide actionable insights for business impact 📈

🧠 Tech Stack

Python 3.12+
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
scikit-learn, xgboost, tensorflow.keras
